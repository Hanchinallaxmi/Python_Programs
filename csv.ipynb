The battle was fought in two engagements on August 16, 1777 and resulted in a decisive victory for the Americans. As a result, Burgoyne's army suffered irreplaceable losses and failed to gather the supplies needed for a timely push on Albany. Burgoyne later surrendered on October 17 after the Battles of Saratoga.Visitors to the battlefield will find a series of interpretive signs, 2.7 mile trail system, picnic area, and information building.

The house was actively utilized from 1777 - 1783 when Poughkeepsie was the capital of New York State and several branches of state government convened in town. After a fire in 1783, General George Washington's New Windsor Cantonment ordered carpenters to rebuild this important structure. In addition to repairs, the house was enlarged and the present stairway was constructed at this time.Clinton House State Historic Site has foundations which are two feet thick. The walls are constructed of rough fieldstone, while the gabled ends are made of wood.

Long before the American Revolution these colonial powers both laid claim to the Champlain Valley and this strategically important peninsula known as Crown Point. The French built Fort St. Frederic here between 1734 and 1737 and used it as a base for raids on British settlements in New York and New England. As a result, the British mounted various expeditions to take control of Crown Point, and in 1759 they were finally successful. They immediately began construction of new fortifications that they called \"His Majesty\\'s Fort of Crown Point\". Enclosing over seven acres this was one of the largest built by the British in North America.In 1775, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the American colonists captured the fort and secured sorely needed cannons and heavy ordnance. Crown Point was occupied by General John Burgoyne\\'s army in 1777 after the American evacuation to Mount Independence and remained under British control until the end of the war. The ruins of Fort St. Frederic, \"His Majesty\\'s Fort of Crown Point,\" and surrounding lands were acquired by the State of New York in 1910.Today, visitors can explore the preserved ruins of these forts and tour the museum which includes a multimedia orientation program, large scale models, and an exhibit of original artifacts recovered from the site by archaeologists.

Construction of his residence on the colonial frontier was completed around 1764. General Herkimer's place in history was assured in 1777 when he assembled 800 militiamen, supported by 60 allied Oneida warriors, and marched to defend Ft. Stanwix against a British siege. Considered to be a significant turning point in the Revolutionary War, the Battle of Oriskany, fought on August 6, 1777, has been described as one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Although wounded in the leg, Herkimer kept command during the fierce combat. After the battle he was carried home where he died 10 days later from complications following the amputation of his leg. Herkimer's estate was home to many over the years, including his family, enslaved people who helped run the estate, soldiers encamped during the war, and neighbors seeking refuge from the fighting in the Mohawk Valley.

There he learned the rhythms of nature and the connections between all living things, lessons that shaped his career as a literary naturalist.Much of his adult life was spent on a small farm overlooking the Hudson River in West Park, Ulster County where he grew grapes, and celery while perfecting the art of the nature essay. His work appeared in Harper\\'s, Scribner\\'s, Atlantic Monthly and other magazines of the day, opening the eyes of his 19th- and 20th-century contemporaries to the wonders of the natural world right outside their doors.His essays were collected in books that sold more than a million and a half copies in his lifetime and were required reading in schools across the country. He became a respected friend of such luminaries as novelist Hamlin Garland and Ida Tarbell, industrialists Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone and Thomas Edison; and political leaders including Teddy Roosevelt, who wrote of Burroughs, \"It is a good thing for our people that you should have lived.\"In 1899 he served as the historian on the Harriman Expedition exploring the coast of Alaska with conservationist John Muir, painter Louis Agassiz, photographer Edward Curtis and a host of scientists.But always his heart remained in the Catskills. \"Those hills comfort me as no other place in the world,\" he wrote. And so, in 1910, Burroughs returned to the comfort of the family farm to spend summers in a little farmhouse he named Woodchuck Lodge. There he continued to write in a hay barn up the road, and there he entertained neighbors and luminaries alike.While he was not a strict conservationist or an environmental activist, his message of land stewardship and his quiet warnings about the potential impact of unchecked development and resource consumption resonate today.John Burroughs died March 29, 1921. He was buried on his 84th birthday in what is now Burroughs Memorial Field, a state historic site just up the road from Woodchuck Lodge and within a mile of the farmstead where he was raised.Woodchuck Lodge, is open for tours the first weekend of each month, May through October, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Memorial Field, where an outdoor exhibit offers photos and information about the life and work of John Burroughs, is open to visitors during daylight hours daily.Mailing Addressc/o Mine Kill State ParkPO Box 923, Route 30North Blenheim, NY 12131', 'Picnic Area, Tours']\n",

Johnson was the largest single landowner and most influential individual in the colonial Mohawk Valley. His success in dealing with the Six Nations of the Iroquois greatly influenced England's victory over France for control of colonial North America. For his service, the British Crown bestowed upon Johnson the title of Baronet, and later appointed him Superintendent of Indian Affairs, a position to which he devoted himself and held throughout his life.Differing cultures, traditions and languages combined to create a unique life for the Johnson family, with the Hall bustling with activity as home life and business life intermingled daily. Visitors included members of various Indian tribes, sometimes numbering in the hundreds at Council gatherings. The home was the centerpiece of a 700-acre working estate, with gardens, a mill, blacksmith shop, Indian store, barns, slave and servant housing and other essential buildings.Following the death of Sir William in 1774, Molly and her children left Johnson Hall, and his eldest son John inherited the property and title of Baronet. The Revolution would cause this Loyalist family to eventually flee to Canada, and the Johnson Hall property and most of its contents were subsequently sold at auction following the War.

By late December 1782, they had erected nearly 600 log huts into a \"cantonment,\" a military enclave.

Overlooking the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains, Staatsburgh is a fine example of a great estate built by America's financial and industrial leaders during the Gilded Age (1876 - 1917). Also known as the American Renaissance, this period in American history was marked by America's rapid economic growth and emergence as a world power. Darius Ogden Mills, father of Ogden Mills, established the family fortune by investing in banks, railroads and mines. Ogden Mills, like his father, was a noted financier and philanthropist. In 1882 he married Ruth Livingston, whose family had been prominent landowners in the Hudson Valley since the 17th century. In 1890, Ruth Livingston Mills inherited her childhood home and property which had once belonged to her great-grandfather, Morgan Lewis, the third governor of New York State.In the 1890s Mr. & Mrs. Mills commissioned the prestigious New York City architectural firm of McKim, Mead and White to remodel and enlarge their home. Work began in 1895 and when completed in 1896, the house had been transformed from a 25-room Greek Revival style home into a Beaux-Arts mansion of 65 rooms and 14 bathrooms. Although the interior was lavishly decorated, mostly in the styles of 17th and 18th-century France, many architectural features of the earlier Livingston home such as the all the trims, moldings and many of the fireplaces had been preserved. This melding of grandeur and heritage is characteristic of the American Renaissance period. Owning five homes, the Mills family resided in their Staatsburg home primarily in the fall and entertained as many as 80 guests at a time. The home and surrounding property was passed to their son, Ogden Livingston Mills in 1929. After his death in 1937 his sister Gladys Mills Phipps inherited the property and in 1938 donated the house and 192 acres of the estate to the State of New York as a memorial to her parents. The historic rooms are filled with the family's original furniture, art, and decorative arts, along with carefully conserved and restored items.Today the elegant mansion, restored to its turn-of-the-century appearance, is open for tours and the house and grounds offer special events throughout the year.The mansion is partially accessible: the basement level and the main tour floor are both accessible from different entrances.

His program greatly increased the morale and strengthened the army. He authored the \"Blue Book,\" which still remains a basic reference for military training and organization.After the war, Congress granted von Steuben a life annuity and New York State deeded him a large parcel of land in appreciation for his wartime contributions.

In 1999, the Stonewall Inn and surrounding site was the first property in the United States listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with LGBT civil rights.Mailing Address26 Wall Street, Federal Hall National Monument c/o Stonewall National Monument New York , NY 10005\", '']\n",

Sir Henry Clinton, Commander-In-Chief of the British forces in America, attempted to coerce General George Washington into one decisive battle to control the Hudson River. As part of his strategy, Clinton fortified Stony Point. Washington devised a plan for Wayne to lead an attack on the garrison. Armed with bayonets only, the infantry captured the fort in short order, ending British control of the river.The Stony Point Lighthouse, built in 1826, is the oldest lighthouse on the Hudson River. De-commissioned in 1925, it now stands as a historical reminder of the importance of lighthouses to commerce on the Hudson River. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 unleashed a surge of commercial navigation along the Hudson River, by linking New York city to America's heartland. Within a year, the first of the Hudson's fourteen lights shone at Stony Point and others soon followed, designed to safely guide maritime travel along the river. Many light keepers, including several remarkable women such as Nancy and Melinda Rose at Stony Point, made their homes in the lighthouse complexes, and ensured that these important navigational signals never failed to shine.The site features a museum, which offers exhibits on the battle and the Stony Point Lighthouse, as well as interpretive programs, such as reenactments highlighting 18th century military life, cannon and musket firings, cooking demonstrations, and children's activities and blacksmith demonstrations.No Pets AllowedMailing AddressP.O.

The facilities at the camps, which are nestled in the woods next to the many lakes at Harriman State Park, consist of dining halls and recreation buildings, cabins and tent platforms, and waterfront facilities. Nature Centers offer environmental education programs designed to teach campers about the woods and instill in them a lifelong sense of wonder for the natural sciences.For generations, the group camps have provided children and families with their first outdoor experiences. The camps are operated by a wide variety of organizations, from outdoor recreation clubs to not-for profits servicing homeless children and the disabled, from the surrounding New York and New Jersey area.
